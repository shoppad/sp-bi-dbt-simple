      The int_shops model is a comprehensive database that provides detailed
      insights into the behavior and performance of online shops. It tracks key metrics
      such as the number of orders, total sales, and the shop's lifecycle from installation
      to uninstallation. It also categorizes shops based on their age and status,
      and monitors changes in their subscription plans. This information can be used
      to identify trends, understand customer behavior, and make informed business
      decisions. For example, it can help identify which shops are most profitable,
      or when shops are most likely to upgrade their plans.
